# Redux

Redux is a caching system, event stream handler, and state distribution hub for reactive style applications.  It was built with React in mind, but has an integration path for a few other major frameworks as well.  If you want to cache remote calls, or componentize your app's data, Redux is for you.

## Level 1

* [Read the Intro & Basics of the Gitbook](http://redux.js.org/)
* [Watch the intro series](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)
* Install Redux into a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) project.
* Install the [Redux dev tools](http://extension.remotedev.io/).

### You should be able to

* Write the actions and reducers for a CRUD list.
* Create React components that connect to the Redux store.
* Interact with the Redux store without using React, through the Devtools.

## Level 2

* Read the Advanced & beyond portions of the Gitbook.
* Watch the [Idiomatic Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux) series.
* Read the [Full Stack Redux tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html)
* Integrate [Immutable.js]() into a new `create-react-app` project.
* Integrate [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) and [Normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr) into a new `create-react-app` project.
* Integrate the [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) (useful for complex asynchronous code, and advanced stream processing) with a new `create-react-app` project.

### You should be able to

* Understand and integrate Redux middleware.
* Handle complex asynchronous operations cleanly and testably.
* Test drive the creation of redux application behavior and state.
* Know how to cache and fetch from plain object and immutable state trees.
* Know the best practices for organizing fetched data into state trees.
* Understand when would be the best time to use the various support libraries, but more importantly, when *not to worry about it*.
